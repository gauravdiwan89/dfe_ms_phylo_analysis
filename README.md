# Phylogenetic analysis for DFE MS (Sane et al 2020)

This repository contains the R script and files to reproduce the panels of Figure 5 (pre-Illustrator adjustments). The code also simulates the character histories for 11 enzymes in the main manuscript. The files in the data folder with "XXX_enz_transitions.csv" in the name contain the state of each enzyme at every node in the tree as inferred from the ancestral reconstruction. The files of the ancestral reconstruction itself are very large to add and process and hence only the processed files have been included.
